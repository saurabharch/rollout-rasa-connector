# What's Rollout?
Rollout is the open source conversational platform that easily connects humans and chatbots.

Designed to be open source since the beginning, we actively worked on it to create a totally new, first class customer service platform based on instant messaging.

What is Rollout today? It became the open source ‚Äúconversational app development‚Äù platform that everyone needs üòå

You can use Rollout to increase sales for your website or for post-sales customer service. Every conversation can be automated using our first class native chatbot technology. You can also connect your own applications using our APIs or Webhooks. Moreover you can deploy entire visual applications inside a conversation. And your applications can converse with your chatbots or your end-users! We know this is cool üòé

Rollout is multichannel in a totally new way. You can write your chatbot scripts with images, buttons and other cool elements that your channels support. But you will configureyour chatbot replies only once. They will run on every channel, auto-adapting the responses to the target channel whatever it is, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram etc.

If you want to discover more about Rollout you can switch to the [Rollout Website](https://rollout.com) or read online documentation on our [Developer Hub](https://developer.rollout.com).

Rollout instant messaging engine is based on MQTT and Rabbitmq technology. It is fast, lightweight and reliable.

On top of our instant messaging engine, we developed many tools that can help you accomplish your daily tasks with your customers, your operators and your teammates.

# What's Rasa?
Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contextual assistants on:

Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously discussed ‚Äì Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.
